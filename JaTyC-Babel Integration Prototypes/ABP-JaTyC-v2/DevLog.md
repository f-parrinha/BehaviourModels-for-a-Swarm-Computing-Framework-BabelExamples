# DevLog
This second version for the Jatyc integration with Babel does not change most of the initial implementation without
JaTyC. The main changes are the use of certain wrappers that allow for better protocol checking

## TODO
- Typestate for main protocol
- Check other typestates that may be useful to improve protocol evaluation
