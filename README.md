# BehaviourModels for a Swarm Computing Framework
### Babel Examples

The prototype projects in this repository were devoleped during the planning for the thesis BehaviourModels for a Swarm Computing Framework. There are three prototype projects: Alternating Bit Protocol, Number Set Protocol and Bit Vote Protocol

It uses both JaTyC and Babel tools. There are two folders: Babel Only and JaTyC-Babel Integration Prototypes. 

#### Babel Only
This folder contains all developed protocols using ONLY the Babel framework

#### JaTyC-Babel Integration Prototypes
This folder contains the code for the experimentation done for the integration of both tools. For some protocols there are two versions, being the second one the latest and best integration done for that given prototype.
